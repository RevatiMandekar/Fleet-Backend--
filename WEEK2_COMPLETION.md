```bash
# Create trip
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/trips \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <fleet_manager_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "vehicleId": "<vehicle_id>",
    "driverId": "<driver_id>",
    "origin": "New York",
    "destination": "Boston",
    "startTime": "2024-03-15T09:00:00Z",
    "endTime": "2024-03-15T14:00:00Z",
    "distance": 215,
    "fuelConsumed": 12.5,
    "notes": "Business trip to Boston"
  }'

# Start trip
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:4000/api/trips/<trip_id>/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <driver_token>"

# Complete trip
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:4000/api/trips/<trip_id>/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <driver_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
