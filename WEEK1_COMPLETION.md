# Week 1 - Setup & Authentication âœ… COMPLETED

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal Achieved
Establish backend architecture and secure authentication

## âœ… Tasks Completed

### Core Setup
- âœ… **Node.js + Express project initialized**
- âœ… **MongoDB connected** (with modern connection string)
- âœ… **JWT authentication** for Driver, Fleet Manager, Admin roles
- âœ… **Role-based middleware** for route protection

### Database Models
- âœ… **User Model**: `role`, `name`, `email`, `password` (with bcrypt encryption)
- âœ… **Vehicle Model**: `vehicleNumber`, `type`, `status`, `assignedDriver` (with population)

### API Endpoints
- âœ… **POST /api/auth/register** - User registration with validation
- âœ… **POST /api/auth/login** - User authentication
- âœ… **GET /api/auth/profile** - Get user profile
- âœ… **Role-specific routes** for testing access control

### Additional Features (Beyond Requirements)
- âœ… **Complete Vehicle CRUD** operations
- âœ… **User Management** (Admin only)
- âœ… **Input validation** middleware
- âœ… **Error handling** and consistent responses
- âœ… **Mongoose population** for relationships

## ðŸš€ Deliverables Status

| Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Secure authentication implemented | âœ… | JWT + bcrypt, role-based |
| Role-based route access working | âœ… | Admin, Fleet Manager, Driver |
| Database models verified | âœ… | User & Vehicle with relationships |

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Week 1 Implementation

### 1. Register Users
```bash
# Register Admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Admin User","email":"admin@gmail.com","password":"admin123","role":"admin"}'

# Register Fleet Manager
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Fleet Manager","email":"manager@yahoo.com","password":"manager123","role":"fleet_manager"}'

# Register Driver
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Driver User","email":"driver@outlook.com","password":"driver123","role":"driver"}'
```

### 2. Test Authentication
```bash
# Login as Admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@gmail.com","password":"admin123"}'
```

### 3. Test Role-Based Access
```bash
# Test Admin access (use token from login response)
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/auth/admin-only \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Test Fleet Manager access
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/auth/fleet-manager-only \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Week 1 Complete!

Your Fleet Management System backend is now ready with:
- **Secure authentication** âœ…
- **Role-based access control** âœ…  
- **Database models** âœ…
- **API endpoints** âœ…



Your Week 1 implementation exceeds the requirements and provides a robust foundation for the complete fleet management system!
